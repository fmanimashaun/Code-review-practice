# My Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This project focus on the testing the code review process flow of github. To achieve this, I am using the code from one of my past projects [Build-a-Survey-Form](https://github.com/KABTF/Build-a-Survey-Form) i made with [@KABTF](https://github.com/KABTF). This project will follow the instructions stated from [Review one of your past projects](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/review_your_project.md).
